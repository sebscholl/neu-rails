# Neu Rails

The goal of this repo is to provide better styling for the view assets generated by `rails generate scaffold [options]` commands. The default style option is influenced by neumorphism, and strictly follow a *no build* principle by being written in pure CSS.

**No altercations need to be made to the default scaffold views when using applying Nue Rails styling.**

## Defaults

The following scaffold commands were used to create the views and partials used for default styling. The fields specified for each model aim to capture a full range of form elements.

Both ActionText and ActiveStoreage are installed and considered in the styling.

```bash
# Setup
$ bundle install && rails active_storage:install && rails action_text:install

# A users model
$ rails g scaffold User name:string bio:text birthday:date age:integer avatar:attachment

# A posts model
rails g scaffold Post title:string body:rich_text published_at:datetime featured:boolean user:references
```
